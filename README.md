# Medical-Research-Database---Project
# Medical Research Database: A comprehensive database system for managing clinical trial data, patient records, study results, and drug information. This project aims to aid researchers in analyzing trends and managing research metadata effectively.
## Description
This Medical Research Database is designed to:
- Store and manage clinical trial data, patient records, and study metadata.
- Track experimental protocols and drug information.
- Provide tools for data analysis, trend visualization, and system performance optimization.

Potential Enhancements:
- Integration of machine learning tools for predictive modeling.
- Real-time updates for ongoing trials.
- Automated data cleaning and maintenance.
- Statistical report generation and auto-correction of user input.
## Features
- **Clinical Trial Management**: Store and manage trial data, including results and protocols.
- **Secure Patient Record Storage**: Ensure data privacy and security.
- **Metadata Management**: Track study details and experimental setups.
- **Trend Analysis**: Tools for visualizing and analyzing trends across studies.
- **Data Cleaning**: Periodic removal or archiving of outdated or non-relevant data.
- **Statistics and Insights**: Generate reports to support data-driven decisions.
- **Auto Spelling Correction**: Ensure input accuracy for stored data.

## Database Design
The database consists of the following key tables:
- `trials`: Stores information about clinical trials (e.g., trial ID, description, status).
- `patients`: Stores secure patient data (e.g., patient ID, medical history, demographics).
- `studies`: Tracks study details and protocols.
- `results`: Stores outcomes and observations from trials.
- `drugs`: Manages drug information (e.g., drug ID, name, properties).
- `metadata`: Tracks experimental and study-related metadata.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/medical-research-database.git`
2. Import the database schema (`schema.sql`) into your database system.
3. Populate the database with sample data using `data-insertion.sql`.
4. Run queries from `queries.sql` to analyze or test the data.
5. Optionally, use the `data-cleaning.sql` script for periodic data cleanup.

## Enhancements and Implementation Details

### Cleaning Old or Non-Important Data
**What It Is:** Over time, outdated or irrelevant data accumulates in databases, which can slow down performance.  
**How to Implement:** 
- Implement a scheduled SQL job or script (e.g., using CRON jobs or database triggers).
- Example: Archive user accounts inactive for more than a year after notifying the user.

### Creating Statistics from Data
**What It Is:** Generate insights by analyzing stored data to support data-driven decisions.  
**How to Implement:** 
- Write SQL queries for generating reports (e.g., total active trials, patient demographics).
- Visualize statistics using a dashboard tool (e.g., Tableau, Power BI).

### Auto Spelling Correction of Data
**What It Is:** Corrects common spelling errors in user input to maintain data accuracy.  
**How to Implement:** 
- Integrate a Python script or use an API (e.g., Hunspell, SymSpell) to check and correct spelling errors.
- Example: If a user enters “adress,” it can be auto-corrected to “address” before insertion.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Database Management**: MySQL, PostgreSQL.
- **Programming**: Python (for ETL and ML integrations).
- **Visualization**: Tableau, Power BI.
- **APIs**: Spell-check API for auto-correction.
- **Security**: AES encryption for patient records.
